That’s to say use many of CSS files and JS filse and others to decorate, configure the pages according to your will, like clothing a puppy, to make it more like a real website. Tips: As a new user I’ve been puzzled and beset here for a long time because ignorance of the construction of these new things. I looked up to so many many information and material including others' blogsite-build-note or experiences. And if you really want to be more clear about the construction then [BLOGSITE-CONSTRUCTI] can help you. It also help you to understand how to config your site first. Here are steps of quick method: First enter the website of hugo themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/ Glance over the diverse hugo themes and select one theme you prefer to and click it. On the theme page, you can browse the style of the theme . Find the “Quick Start” (maybe it dosen’t exsist then skip current and subsequent steps.) or find directly the command to add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule. The command like this: git submodule add https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git themes/hugo-coder Configure your config.toml which can be found in the site’s root directory. You can only change the theme configuration to the name of your wanted theme’s name. Or a recommended way is copy the config.toml inside the exampleSite in the theme’s directory which you just added and it can be seen in the themes folder. (If you find the “Quick Start” before then skip current and subsequent setps) If it doesn’t exist the command you can directly clone the theme to local then do like this: on the top or the page of the theme you can’t miss the two or sometimes three or other quantitis buttons right left, behind the heading. Find the one which the word “DOWNLOAD” on it. Click it and go to the source webpage “Github repository” and again find the button which represent “DOWNLOAD”. Simply choose “DOWNLOAD as ZIP” and unzip. Once you download them to your root directory then copy or cut them and paste to the folder “themes”. Last, back to root directory and find a file named “.gitmodules” to open it. You’ll find several similar statements if you have the experience of using command “git submodule”. Write one in their image and the url is right the URL of the webpage which you download the zip source from. Or directly just refer to this: [submodule \"themes/ananke\"] path = themes/ananke url = https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git You must replace the name of theme and the path and the url accordingly. Open the file “config.toml” and find the line “theme”, add the name of your choice and the simplest configuration is already set. Further you can modify some of configurations in the config.toml arrording to your preference but that will be detailed explained here, not in the current post. Run the CMD command hugo server -D or hugo server in the site’s root directory to see the result at `http://localhost:1313/. The fomer which contains “-D” means all of your post files will be pushed to local server whether or not it’s labled as draft, so the latter only show the posts which have the “false” value of the “draft”.

Here we have many methods, like Github pages, Gitee pages, and Gitlab pages. Each of them has its own merits. I’ll explain some differences among them later. Here we use Github pages. First you must own a github account. That’s not difficult. Go to http://github.com and sign up. Creat a new repository and give it name “XXX.github.io”. “XXX” equals to your account name. Besides the name can only be this one, not any others. That’s the only rule. Then we need Git. (If you don’t have or don’t know it, here[Git][https://www.zonlin.cn/Git/]) Go back to your root directory and run the CMD command hugo, if no errors or warnings occur then your site is already successfully post to a new folder named “public” in the root. Change the current directory to “public”, right-click to choose the “Git bash here” then a new command line window will start. Now we need to connect the local repostiory with the remote repostiory(Github repo), use git commands: git remote add origin https://github.com/Your account name/Your repository name.git git remote -v #Check the address of your remote repository git remote rm origin #Disconnect the local repo with the remote. If you want to connect not only one remote reprository then add it just like the first line above. git remote add XXX XXX The first “XXX” represents the nickname of your remote repo—you need it to call it in local. The second “XXX” is your repo’s address like the first line. Once you successfully connect the local and the remote, now push all of your contents to your remote repository so that Github pages could configure your site online automatically.

After all, it was a thing I had never thought of before my last year in senior high school. But that major I enrolled, which is Landscape Architecture, had never been kown to me ever before. I know that name for the first time on the website of the college-entrance applicants, at that time there were altogether 5 candidates to choose from and they are Naval architecture and ocean engineering, Electronic Information-specialties, mechanical specialties and LA and I cannot recall the last one now. When I see that name of major “LA”, I smiled in my heart for one second because I knew clearly why this major listed here. And, without hesitation, I made it my final wish on the website. I accepted the major adjustment in the meantime. Soon I received the admission notice and got to know that I was precisely admitted to that major dramatically, I cannot help myself laughing out loud, feeling a little teasing. According to that situation, I was probably ranked in the last one to be admitted by Jiaotong University in applicants who had passed the college Special Plan to recruit in Guizhou, assuming that all of those who ranked before me made the Landscape Architecture the last volunteer was reasonable. How can I occured this, my ranking was no higher, no lower, but right there. I would be at ease start and go ahead on my college road readliy provided I ranked higher and I matched with the other several majors, or, I should had died this heart if I ranked lower. And the fact was that I was stuck at the last one precisely. More than nine out of ten persons around me thought that I should prepare for transfering the major. At that time I shared the news of my admission with mass of my friends and classmates, including my upperclassmen and most of them felt funny and comical and I wanted to laugh as well. Only the H upperclassman studying in SJTU was the most quiet and calm, he said to me that I had no necessary to worry about it because I could make the choice to transfer major. From then on, I began the endless journey of my collecting messages and information about transfering major, and I gathered lots of information based on how much free time I had during that long holidays. But the result was that I got many similar responses: It’s too early to think about this. I did prove this sentence later. After the formal opening of the school, I did not spent so much time to think about this matter, but on my major study. The motivation was not that I wanted to get a high average score to make my transfer-major plan successful at all, but a habit I still kept since high school. Just for this sake I rarely remenbered what I worried about for the entire holiday. The first semester passed soon and my core average score ranked 5/29. But as soon as the semester was over, I return to my deep depress about changing my major again. My \u003cCollege English\u003e course only took an examination of 60 points which cannot be lower. But fortunately My gross average score was in the top 30% —— the minimun requierment to apply to change one’s major. I thought it’s time to motivate myself on English and began to read and recite the words and articles, or read some foreign periodical .etc. And woefully the year 2020 be forced to start with a tragedy——coronavirus diease 2019, which was entitled the name “COVID-19”. A pandemic diease, like the severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) swept over the globe, made billions of people or even more throughout the world painful phsically or mentally. We alse were compeled to attend class and lecture staying at our home. It’s apparent that I put that matter——change my major, aside. I didn’t remenber it when I took online course selection at all and I selected many “meaningless and useless” courses which reminded me of how boring these courses were even more so after I choosed to change the major later.
